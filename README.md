# Aureola's Awesome Accessories

A Unity package containing accessories &amp; utilities that I use in all of my Unity projects.

**Important:** This will always be a **work in progress**, as new services will be added or existing ones will be updated. There will be breaking changes in the future! Although I will try to be as transparent as possible about these changes, things might break. Keep this in mind. My advice is to stick to a certain version of this package as long as possible and in case of updates test things thoroughly.

## Prerequisites

The following packages are required:

- [SimpleJSON](https://github.com/christianhanne/SimpleJSON)
- [Unity Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.addressables.html)
- [Unity TextMeshPro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.textmeshpro.html)

**Note:** You need to install SimpleJSON manually using my fork.

This package should work in all currently supported Unity versions. Please let me know, if you run into any compatibility issues.
