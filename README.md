![Aureola's Awesome Accessories](/Images/awesome-accessories-1024x400.png)

A Unity package containing accessories &amp; utilities that I use in all of my Unity projects.

**Important:** This project currently is a **work in progress** as new services are added or existing ones are updated. There will be breaking changes in the future! Although I will try to be as transparent as possible about these changes, things may break. Keep that in mind. My advice is to test things thoroughly when updates are made.

## Prerequisites

The following packages are required:

- [SimpleJSON for Unity](https://github.com/aureola-codes/SimpleJSON-Unity)
- [Unity Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.addressables.html)
- [Unity TextMeshPro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.textmeshpro.html)

**Note:** You need to install SimpleJSON manually using my fork.

This package should work in all currently supported Unity versions. Please let me know, if you run into any compatibility issues.

## Core Concepts

In order to make this collection of utilities more accessible, I have defined some core concepts that I adhere to when developing this package.

### Managers

Managers are the core of this package. They are responsible for managing a specific problem domain, such as the `AudioManager` for handling audio playback or the `TranslationManager` for handling translations. All managers are Scriptable Objects and can be added to every behaviour in your project. You can have multiple instances of a manager, but you should only have one instance of a manager per behaviour.

### Behaviours

Behaviours are the core of Unity. They are the building blocks of every game or application. This package provides a set of behaviours that can be used to extend the functionality of Unity's built-in behaviours. For example, the `PlayGlobalSound` can be used to play audio clips in a more convenient way.

### Communication & Delegates

Managers and Behaviours communicate with each other using delegates. This allows for a more decoupled architecture and makes it easier to extend the functionality of the package.

### Services

Services are used to provide additional functionality used by certain managers or behaviours. For example, the `FilesService` is used to read and write files to the file system. You need to instantiate services manually inside the behaviour or manager that uses them.

## Installation

### Unity Package

Download the Unity Package from the last published version.

### Manually

You can also just download the source code of this package from Git and copy all or parts of it directly into your project.
