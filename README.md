A Unity package containing accessories &amp; utilities that I use in all of my Unity projects.

## Prerequisites

The following packages are required:

- [Unity Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.addressables.html)
- [Unity TextMeshPro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.textmeshpro.html)

Enable the Addressables module by navigating to `Asset Management` -> `Addressables` -> `Groups` and click on `Create Addressables Settings`. This will create a new `AddressableAssetSettings` asset in your project. You can now use the module in your project.

## Installation

### Unity Asset Store

Download the package from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/278356).

### Unity Package (Github)

Download the Unity Package from the last published version on Github.

### Manually

You can also just download the source code of this package from Git and copy all or parts of it directly into your project.

## Core Concepts

In order to make this collection of utilities more accessible, I have defined some core concepts that I adhere to when developing this package.

### Managers

Managers are the core of this package. They are responsible for managing a specific problem domain, such as the `AudioManager` for handling audio playback or the `TranslationManager` for handling translations. All managers are Scriptable Objects and can be added to every behaviour in your project. You can have multiple instances of a manager, but you should only have one instance of a manager per behaviour.

### Behaviours

Behaviours are the core of Unity. They are the building blocks of every game or application. This package provides a set of behaviours that can be used to extend the functionality of Unity's built-in behaviours. For example, the `PlayGlobalSound` can be used to play audio clips in a more convenient way.

### Communication & Delegates

Managers and Behaviours communicate with each other using delegates. This allows for a more decoupled architecture and makes it easier to extend the functionality of the package.

### Services

Services are used to provide additional functionality used by certain managers or behaviours. For example, the `FilesService` is used to read and write files to the file system. You need to instantiate services manually inside the behaviour or manager that uses them.
