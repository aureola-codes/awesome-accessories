![Aureola's Awesome Accessories](/Assets/awesome-accessories-1024x400.png)

A Unity package containing accessories &amp; utilities that I use in all of my Unity projects.

**Important:** This project currently is a **work in progress** as new services are added or existing ones are updated. There will be breaking changes in the future! Although I will try to be as transparent as possible about these changes, things may break. Keep that in mind. My advice is to test things thoroughly when updates are made.

## Prerequisites

The following packages are required:

- [SimpleJSON for Unity](https://github.com/aureola-codes/SimpleJSON-Unity)
- [Unity Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.addressables.html)
- [Unity TextMeshPro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.textmeshpro.html)

**Note:** You need to install SimpleJSON manually using my fork.

This package should work in all currently supported Unity versions. Please let me know, if you run into any compatibility issues.

## Core Concepts

In order to make this collection of utilities more accessible, I have defined some core concepts that I adhere to when developing this package.

### Services

Services are the core of this collection of development utilities. They are always self-contained by design. All dependencies must be injected using the appropriate constructor. In most cases, I have provided meaningful defaults. You can use as many instances of the same service in parallel as you like.

### Managers

Managers are used to connect **services** & **behaviours** of this package in Unity. All managers are singletons by design. This means that you can only have one instance of a particular manager in your scene. All managers expose settings in the Unity editor. To find out about the available settings of a manager, please refer to the README of the respective module (or namespace).

### Behaviours

All the scripts you can use on any game object in Unity are called behaviours. They are usually used to take advantage of a single feature of a particular **service**. For example, they are used to synchronize the volume defined by the **AudioService** with other audio sources. Most behaviours depend on the existence of certain **managers**. You can find out which **managers** are required for a particular behaviour by looking at the README of the behaviour's module (or namespace).

### Communication & Events

All **services** use [delegates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/using-delegates) to communicate changes or other service-related events to the outside world. **Managers** listen to these delegates and (if necessary) publish events using the **PubSubManager**. **Behaviours** always use the **PubSubManager** to listen for events of interest. To find out when an event is triggered, please refer to the README of the respective module (or namespace).
